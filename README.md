    Computer Graphics Course Repository</h1>
<p>Welcome to my OpenGL
    Computer Graphics Course Repository! This repository contains two
    projects: the 3D Scene Exploration App and the 2D Game App. These
    projects were created as part of a computer graphics course and are
    not intended to be used as programming references. They are meant
    solely for educational purposes.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Please
    note that these projects are not well programmed and should not be
    used as references for programming practices or techniques. They
    were created as a way for me to learn and practice using OpenGL
    graphics in a practical context, and are not representative of
    production-level code.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3D Scene
        Exploration App: This app allows the user to explore a 3D scene
        using OpenGL graphics. The user can use various controls such as
        zoom, rotate, and pan to navigate through the scene.</li>
    <li>2D
        Game App: This app is a simple 2D game where the player can move
        around using the mouse and shoot with the left click. The goal
        of the game is to destroy enemies to boost
        your score.</li>
</ul>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Operating
        System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.</li>
    <li>Graphics Card: Your
        graphics card should support OpenGL 2.1 or higher.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To
    use these apps, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone this repository
        to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Run the <code>./script.sh</code>
        script to install the necessary dependencies and libraries for
        the apps, and to create the executable applications.</li>
    <li>Run
        the command <code>./exe</code> to launch the 3D Scene
        Exploration App, or the 2D
        Game App.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
